Refuse Robots

  "Waste is a human concept: in natural processes there is no waste, only inert
  end products."

Quick Start Guide

I. Introduction
  Welcome to the wonderful world of large scale robotic warfare.  In this
futuristic world, you can build an army of robots to take over the piles of
garbage.  Nanites on each pile of garbage, or "landfill", let you create any
unit you desire. But be warned: more powerful units take longer to build,
leaving you open to attack.

II. Building an army
  If you skipped the introduction for a really quick start, then kudos. Click
on your scrapyard and you can select which units you want to create. The
first thing you're going to want to do is take over additional scrapyards, so
build a barrel of nanites (N). Later, you'll want to switch to producing tanks.

III. Taking over scrapyards
  You'll need a barrel of nanites and a transport to take over a scrapyard. You
start with a transport, so once the nanites are done, load them onto the
transport by selecting the transport and right-clicking on the nanites. Then,
press TAB to zoom out, find a destination for it (a gray circle indicates an
available scrapyard), and right-click there to start moving. Once you reach
your destination, unload (U) your nanites.

IV. Moving around
To switch to an overhead map view, hold ctrl and right-click, or press tab. To get back to normal view, do the same.  Now, to select multiple units you can drag your mouse to create a box over them. To move them to a location, you can press M and left click or right click on an empty patch of ground.

V. Attacking
  Attacking is done automatically.  Trust me, you have enough to worry about
without trying to select a group and right click on enemy units or pressing A
and clicking, or even using a chic button menu and clicking.  Just move your
units near enemy units and watch the sparks fly!

VI. Capture an enemy's landfill and Win
  Pretty soon, every scrapyard will be producing units either for you or for
your opponent.  In order to capture an opponent's landfill, you must create a
nantite container and a transport. Have the transport load the nanite
container, then move the transport to an enemy landfill. When you reach the
enemy landfill, click unload, and the landfill will be taken over after a
battle with the opposing nanites. Capture all enemy landfills and you win!
